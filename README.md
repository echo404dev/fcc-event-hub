# My Learning Journey: HTML Semantics 🌐

In this repository, I’m documenting my progress as I learn the basics of **HTML semantics**. This project was focused on building an **Event Hub** while reviewing and applying various semantic HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, and others.

## 📚 What I've Learned

### 1. **HTML Semantics**
   - **Semantic HTML** elements help structure a web page in a meaningful way. These elements describe their content clearly, making websites more accessible and improving search engine optimization (SEO).
   - Key semantic elements I’ve used include:
     - `<header>`: Defines the introductory content of the page or a section.
     - `<nav>`: Represents navigation links.
     - `<article>`: Specifies a self-contained piece of content that can be distributed or reused independently.
     - `<section>`: Represents a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.
     - `<footer>`: Contains information about its containing element (usually at the bottom of a page).
   
### 2. **Building an Event Hub**
   - I’ve built an event hub that organizes upcoming and past events using semantic HTML elements. This helped me practice structuring content in a meaningful way and focusing on accessibility.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **HTML5**: Main language used to structure the content and apply semantics.
- **freeCodeCamp**: The platform I used to write and test the code for this project.
  
## 🌱 Next Steps
- Learn **CSS** to style the Event Hub and make it visually appealing.
- Get familiar with **GitHub** to host and version-control my projects.
- Continue exploring more advanced HTML concepts and learn **JavaScript** for adding interactivity.

This README serves as a reflection of what I’ve learned so far in my journey to becoming a web developer. I’m excited to continue exploring and building more projects!
